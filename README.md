Basic Improvement Proposals (BIPs)

The primary mechanisms for suggesting new functionality, gathering technical input, and documenting design/development decisions for [TEDDi](https://themichaelacompany.com/teddi/). Each BIP presents a specific process, method, or idea, offering a clear rationale and concise specifications. BIPs track the evolution of TEDDi and serve as a historical record of design/development decisions.

What is a BIP?

A BIP (Basic Improvement Proposal) is a document that introduces a new process, method, or idea aimed at enhancing TEDDi. Each proposal includes a clear specification and rationale, with the author responsible for building consensus within the community and addressing any dissenting viewpoints.

BIPs provide a transparent and organized means of proposing changes that impact the broader community, ensuring that the collective’s governance and technical decisions are well-documented and accessible.

BIP Rationale

BIPs serve as the main tool for proposing new features, gathering technical feedback, and recording design decisions. As version-controlled documents, they form a historical record of the evolution of proposals. Additionally, BIPs enable authors to track the progress of their proposals and the implementation of any changes.

Submitting a Proposal

To submit a BIP, follow these steps:

Fork the Repository: Fork the Basic Improvement repository to your GitHub account.
Create a New BIP File: Within the proposals/ folder, create a new markdown file (e.g., BIP-<number>.md) and follow the [BIP template](https://bips.ma8.company/bips_template/) for formatting your proposal.
Write Your Proposal: Clearly describe the proposed process, method, or feature, including the rationale and expected impact.
Submit a Pull Request: When your proposal is ready, submit a pull request to the proposals/ folder, with a description of the changes.
Make sure to adhere to the BIP format and guidelines. Engage with the community for feedback and revisions as necessary.

Current Proposals

Here are the current proposals within the Basic Improvement Foundation:

BIP-1: Purpose and Guidelines – Describes the purpose and process for submitting BIPs.
BIP-2: BIP Editor Handbook – A comprehensive guide for BIP Editors, detailing the responsibilities, processes, and best practices for managing and reviewing Brown Improvement Proposals (BIPs). This handbook ensures consistency and clarity in the editorial oversight of proposals, from submission to final approval.
The list of proposals will be updated as new submissions are reviewed and approved.

Proposal Review Process

Once a proposal is submitted, it follows this process:

Initial Review: The governance team will review the proposal for relevance, feasibility, and alignment with the foundation’s objectives.
Community Feedback: Proposals are open for community feedback to refine and improve them.
Approval: After adequate discussion, the proposal may be accepted, rejected, or deferred for further development.
Once approved, the BIP becomes part of the official record and may be implemented.

BIP Types

There are three primary types of BIPs, each serving a distinct purpose:

Standards Track BIPs: These proposals define new standards or changes to existing systems that affect multiple implementations or applications. Types of Standards Track BIPs include:
Core: Proposals requiring consensus forks or other critical changes to the core of the application.
Networking: Proposals related to network improvements or protocol updates.
Interface: Proposals related to language-level standards or API specifications.
Meta BIPs: These define processes, governance changes, or events within the field but are not directly tied to the application codebase. Meta BIPs require community consensus and are often process-related.
Informational BIPs: These provide general information or guidelines, but do not propose new features. Informational BIPs may address non-critical issues or offer recommendations.
